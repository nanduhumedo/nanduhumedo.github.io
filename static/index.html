    Okay, so basic instructions.  To start click on a word you would like to guess.  It will reveal a new letter.  You can only guess words with another
    word started next to them.  After clicking, type a guess into the guess box.  DO NOT HIT ENTER. I don't know why it takes you off the page,
    but it does.  So just use the mouse please.  It will then either show a popup that says correct, reveal the word, and add your score...or do
    absolutely nothing to indicate you got it wrong.  Feel free to hit the button to show correct answers.

    Words and phrases are randomly taken from phrases seen in Moby Dick at every refresh.  As such some of them are pretty rough and make no sense
    at all.  I'll fix that sometime, probably.
    <br/>
    But that gives opportunity for expansion into the user supplying their own book or a recorded conversation with someone etc. and randomly
    generating phrases those people would be likely to say, which is neat.
    <br/>
    Oh yeah, if nothing comes up just refresh.  Sometimes it can't find a way to make a full puzzle and just kinda gives up.  I can make it try harder
    if that happens a lot.
